# AS I BEGAN TO LOVE MYSELF

CHARLIE CHAPLIN ON HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY

As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth.

当我真正开始爱自己，我发觉烦闷和痛苦， 不过是警示我，我过去曾违心而活。

Today, I know, this is AUTHENTICITY.

今天，我明白了，这便是“真实”。

As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me.

当我真正开始爱自己，我才发觉以一己之私欲强人所难，是何等的冒犯，即便我知道，时候未到，人也未有准备，即便那人便是我自己。

Today I call it RESPECT.

今天，我称之为“尊重”。

As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow.

当我真正开始爱自己，我不在渴求别样的生活，目光所及，周遭的一切都在促使我成长。

Today I call it MATURITY.

今天，我称之为“成熟”。

As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment, so I could be calm.

当我真正开始爱自己，我明白了在任何情况下，我都出现在对的地点，对的时间；世事皆注定，而我也得以从容不迫。

Today I call it SELF-CONFIDENCE.

今天，我称之为“自信”。

As I began to love myself I quit steeling my own time, and I stopped designing huge projects for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm.

当我真正开始爱自己，我不在匆匆忙忙，也不再计划未来的壮举。如今，我只行快乐之事。只行热爱之事，只行欢心之事，——以我自己的方式，自己的节奏。

Today I call it SIMPLICITY.

今天，我称之为“诚实”。

As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health – food, people, things, situations, and everything the drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.

当我真正开始爱自己，我让自己远离一切有损健康之事 —— 事物，人群，事物，处境，或者一切让我心神疲惫，背离初心之事。起初，我称这样的态度为“健康的利己”。

Today I know it is LOVE OF ONESELF.

而今天，我称之为“关爱自我”。

As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong less of the time.

当我真正开始爱自己，我不在试图永不犯错，而从此，我犯的错误却更少了。

Today I discovered that is MODESTY.

今天，我发觉，这便是“谦逊”。

As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worry about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where EVERYTHING is happening.

当我真正开始爱自己，我拒绝担忧过去和未来。此刻，我只活在当下，见证着当下发生的一切。

Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it FULFILLMENT.

如今我专注每一天，我称之为“尽善”。

As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But As I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally.

当我真正开始爱自己，我意识到，思绪或许会让我饱受煎熬。但当我连结心灵之时，我的思绪便成了宝贵的盟友。

Today I call this connection WISDOM OF THE HEART.

如今，我称这个连接为“心灵的智慧”。

We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born.

我们无需再惧怕纷争，对抗，自身或他人的任何问题。纵使星星也会相撞，由此诞生出新的世界。

Today I know THAT IS “LIFE“!

今天我知道了，这便是人生。
